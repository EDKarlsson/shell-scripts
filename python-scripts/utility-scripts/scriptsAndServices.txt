Script: add view to view (same as in view editor),
addview sysmlIdOfViewToAdd sysmlIdOfViewToWhichTheOtherViewIsAdded

Service:
To add view to view (same behavior as above but with a URL specific to it)

Maybe create a service for POSTing to https://ems/alfresco/service/workspaces/workspaceId/views/subViewId/parentViewId with no data/payload

For reference, here’s a command that posts views from a json file:
curl -w "\n%{http_code}\n" -u admin:admin -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" --data @JsonData/views.json "http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/workspaces/master/views"

For reference, here’s the RAML page: https://ems.jpl.nasa.gov/alfresco/mms/raml/index.html

Other scripts:
Some of these are easier than others, mainly because the URL already exists.
The easier ones: 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.  Special cases of 9 are 10, 12, and 13.  11 involves multiple calls to 9.
It would be nice to include [workspace] and [timestamp] options wherever applicable — I only included it for the first one.

idget sysmlidOrName [workspace] [timestamp]
returns the sysml:id sysml:name cm:name and alfresco id of elements matching the id/name, workspace, and version at the specified time
evaluate sysmlid
just does a modelget adding the ?evaluate parameter
evaluate “k expression”
returns elements generated from parsing  k with evaluation results
k “k expression”
same as previous but returns just the evaluation result
tok sysmlid
return the k for this element; for example, if the element is an Expression, return the k equivalent expression
aspectget sysmlid
return the aspects of the sysmlid
versionsget sysmlid
return all of the versions of the element, adding a version label and alfresco id to the json of each element version
versionsget sysmlid short
return the version labels, ids, and modification dates of the element
search “some string” (id, documentation, name, value, aspect, appliedMetatypes, metatypes)
returns all elements with the string matching all or part of the specified attribute
for example, search “my cat” documentation
searchname name
returns all elements with that name (or with that as a substring of the name)
searchtype type
returns all elements with that type, aspect, or metatype (or those with a matching substring)
searchdoc “some string”
return all elements whose documentation contains the given string
searchvalue value
returns all elements with that value or having that as a substring of the value
childrenget sysmlid
return all owned children
propertyget sysmlId [propertyName]
return all Property elements whose owner is this, with optional propertyName filtering the results
relationshipget sysmlid [relationshipName]
return all relationship elements involving this element, with optional relationshipName filtering the results
targetget sysmlid [relationshipName]
return all targets of relationships involving this element with optional relationshipName filtering the results
otherendget sysmlid [relationshipIdOrName]
return elements at the other end of relationships involving this element with optional relationshipIdOrName filtering the results
constraintget sysmlid [evaluate]
return all constraints in which the element is involved, optionally including the results of evaluating them
